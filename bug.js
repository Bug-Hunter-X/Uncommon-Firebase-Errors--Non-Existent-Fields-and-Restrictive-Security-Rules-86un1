The Firebase SDK might throw an error if you try to access a field that doesn't exist in your Firestore document.  For example, if you have a document with a field named `name`, but you try to access `age`, you will get an error. This is especially common when dealing with nested data.  Consider the following code:

```javascript
db.collection('users').doc('user1').get().then(doc => {
  console.log(doc.data().address.street); // Error if address or street doesn't exist
});
```

Another error is related to security rules. If your Firestore security rules are too restrictive, your app might not be able to read or write data.  This can lead to unexpected behavior, with your app seemingly failing without clear error messages.
